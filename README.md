This is a web based stepper control system.

Using the above code and the following components:-
1. ESP8266
2. Nema Stepper Motor
3. A4988 Motor driver
4. 100uF capacitor
5. 12v powersupply for the driver

You can easily control the rotational aspect of the stepper motor, i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise movement.

This code has been tested and deployed miltiple time, so if you're encountering any compiling related issues, make sure you install all the lib and board managers properly.
